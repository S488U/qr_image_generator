# QR Code Generator

My first Project with Node JS. 
I used to Node Package Manager(npm) to get the result. 

First one is, [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). It used two get the input from the User. We need the URL from the user. 

Second one is, [qr-image](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qr-image). it used to convert the user input to Image.

## How to run:

1. Open your Terminal.
2. Git Clone the project: ` git clone https://github.com/S488U/qr_image_generator.git`
3. First of all open the folder qr_image_generator `cd qr_image_generator`
4. run the command `npm install`
5. To generate the Image: run the command, `node ./index.js`
6. It will ask you to enter the prompt. Enter the full url of a website with `http` or `https`
7. The generated Image will be stored inside the root folder. Named as `qr_img.png`
