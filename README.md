# QR Code Generator

My first Project with Node JS. 
I used two Node Package Manager(npm) to get the result. 

First one is, [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). It used two get the input from the User. We need the URL from the user. 

Second one is, [qr-image](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qr-image). it used to convert the user input to Image.

## How to run:

1. Open your Terminal.
2. First of all navigate the folder qr_image_generator. 
3. run the command `npm install`
4. To generate the Image: run the command, `node ./index.js`
5. It will ask you to enter the prompt. Enter the full url of a website with `http` or `https`
6. The generated Image will be stored inside the root folder. Named as `qr_img.png`
